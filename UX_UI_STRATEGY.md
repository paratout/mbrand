## 7. Performance Considerations

### **Image Optimization** (Pending)

**Required Images:**
- `favicon.svg` - Site icon
- `og-image.jpg` - Social sharing (1200x630px)
- `blog/*.jpg` - Blog post featured images

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Use WebP format with JPEG fallback
- Lazy loading for below-fold images
- Responsive images with srcset
- CDN delivery via Cloudflare

### **Animation Performance**

✅ **CSS Transforms Only**
- All animations use `transform` and `opacity`
- GPU-accelerated properties
- No layout thrashing
- Smooth 60fps performance

✅ **Reduced Motion Support**
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

### **Bundle Size**

Current JavaScript bundle: **135.60 KB** (gzipped: 43.79 KB)
- React: Necessary for interactive components
- Minimal third-party dependencies
- Code splitting by route

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Consider Preact for smaller bundle (~3KB vs 40KB)
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Tree-shake unused Tailwind classes

### **CTA Placement Strategy**

1. **Hero CTA** - Primary action (Explore Expertise)
2. **Feature Cards** - Micro-conversions (Explore, Read, View)

### **Friction Reduction**

✅ **Clear Value Proposition**

- Specific, not generic

✅ **Multiple Conversion Paths**
- Primary: Contact form
- Secondary: Service pages
- Tertiary: About page (relationship building)

✅ **Trust Building**

### **A/B Testing Recommendations**

**Test 1: Hero CTA Text**
